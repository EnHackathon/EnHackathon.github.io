EnHackathon is a time for employees in the Ensoft Cisco office to contribute to
open source Python, with a strong focus on contributing to CPython itself. 

EnHackathon is in its first year, with 5 days of contribution being spread
over the month of November. We have 12 engineers signed up to spend 2-5 days
each, with almost all of us being entirely new to the CPython codebase!

All contributors are strongly encouraged to submit a blog post for each day of
contribution, all of which can be found below.

If the first year is a success there's a high chance of doing something similar
in upcoming years! Read our [about page](about.html) for more information.
